# Whatâ€™s a design pattern?

* `Design patterns` are `typical solutions` to `commonly occurring problems` in software design. 
* They are like `pre-made blueprints` that you can `customize to solve` a recurring design problem in your code.

* The pattern is `not a specific piece of code`, but `a general concept` for `solving a particular problem.`

### Patterns and algorithms

* **Similar**
  * Both concepts describe `typical solutions to some known problems`.

* **Difference**
  * `An algorithm` always `defines a clear set of actions` that can achieve some goal. 
    * *An algorithm is `a cooking recipe`: both have `clear steps to achieve a goal`.*

  * `A patter` describes a solution. -> *more high-level*
    * *A pattern is more like `a blueprint`: you can see `what the result and its features` are, but the exact `order of implementation is up to you.`*

*The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.*


# What does the pattern consist of?

* **`Intent`** of the pattern `briefly describes both the problem and the solution.`
* **`Motivation`** further `explains the problem and the solution` the pattern makes possible.
* **`Structure`** of classes `shows each part of the pattern` and `how they are related.`
* **`Code example`** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
