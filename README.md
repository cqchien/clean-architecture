[**What is Design Pattern:**](definition.md) `Design Pattern` are `typical solutions` to `common problems`
in software design. Each pattern is like a `blueprint`. 

**Benefits of patterns:** Patterns are a `toolkit of solutions` to `common problems` in software design. They define
`a common language` that helps your team `communicate more efficiently.`

**Criticism of patterns:** 
* *Inefficient solutions:* `without adapting` them to `the context` of their project.
* *Unjustified use:* They try to `apply them everywhere`, even in situations where `simpler code would do just fine`.

[**Classification of patterns:**](classification.md) Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.
